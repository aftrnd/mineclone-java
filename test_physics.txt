=== MINECRAFT MOVEMENT PHYSICS SIMULATION ===

Constants (from Minecraft 1.21.11 source):
- MOVEMENT_SPEED = 0.1
- SLIPPERINESS = 0.6  
- GROUND_FRICTION_BASE = 0.91

Calculation:
1. Movement factor = speed * (0.16277136 / (slipperiness^3))
   = 0.1 * (0.16277136 / (0.6^3))
   = 0.1 * (0.16277136 / 0.216)
   = 0.1 * 0.7536
   = 0.07536 blocks/tick

2. Friction multiplier = slipperiness * 0.91
   = 0.6 * 0.91
   = 0.546

Equilibrium (steady state when holding W):
- Each tick: velocity += input * 0.07536 (acceleration)
- Each tick: velocity *= 0.546 (friction)

At equilibrium:
acceleration = friction_loss
0.07536 = velocity * (1 - 0.546)
0.07536 = velocity * 0.454
velocity = 0.166 blocks/tick

At 20 TPS:
velocity = 0.166 * 20 = 3.32 blocks/second

BUT WE MEASURE: 1.8 blocks/second!

That's 54% of calculated...

WAIT! Let me check if we're applying friction twice or something...
